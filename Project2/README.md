# CSCI 381 Machine Learning
## Project 2: Linear Classification

### Implement a linear classifier for multi-class classification, with the following requirements:
* Initialize w using
1. the first data point
2. linear regression.
* Vectorize the computation when possible, and implement your own linear classifier
and linear regression routines.
* You may/should call the build-in function for pseudo-inverse.

### Train and validate your implementation with 5 different samples (5 different Ds in
the learning flow) for each of following datasets from sklearn:
* Breast cancer, 2 classes, 30 features, 569 data points
* Iris, 3 classes, 4 features, 150 data points
