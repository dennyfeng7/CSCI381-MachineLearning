# CSCI 381 Machine Learning
## Project 2: Linear Classification

### Implement a linear classifier for multi-class classification, with the following requirements:
* Initialize w using
1. the first data point
2. linear regression.
* Vectorize the computation when possible, and implement your own linear classifier
and linear regression routines.
* You may/should call the build-in function for pseudo-inverse.

### Train and validate your implementation with 5 different samples (5 different Ds inthe learning flow) for each of following datasets from sklearn:
* Breast cancer, 2 classes, 30 features, 569 data points
* Iris, 3 classes, 4 features, 150 data points

1. Solution: Provide the mathematical formulation of your algorithm, with
different initialization mechanisms. The description should be independent of
the programming language.
2. Training and validation:
* Experiment: Description of the setup of the experiment for both datasets,
and evaluation of Ein(g) and Eout(g).
* Result: Show the performance plots using Eout(g) for t (number of iterations)
for both datastes and initialization methods. Once graph (with two
plots) for each dataset.
* Discussion: Discuss the result: what did you observe? what do you learn
from this observation?
